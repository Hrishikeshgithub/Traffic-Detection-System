# Traffic-Detection-System
ðŸš€ Built a Real-Time Traffic Detection System with YOLOv8! ðŸš¦

Just wrapped up a fun project: A vehicle detection and counting system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and PyTorch. This system powers through video streams with efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Detects vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes) in real-time.
âœ… Tracks and counts total vehicles for traffic insights.
âœ… Add-On: Manages traffic by customizing wait times based on vehicle count!

ðŸ’¡ Use Case: Real-time detection can adapt traffic signals dynamicallyâ€”more vehicles, longer waits; fewer vehicles, shorter waitsâ€”easing congestion for smarter cities.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack: YOLOv8 | PyTorch | OpenCV | Python

Coded in VS Code and live on GitHubâ€”take a peek! Would love feedback from the hashtag#AI and hashtag#MachineLearning community. Letâ€™s chat about traffic tech ideas!
